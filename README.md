### Introduction

- Data structures are a well-studied discipline, and the concepts are language agnostic; A data structure from C is functionally and conceptually identical to the same data structure in any other language, such as Dart. At the same time, the high- level expressiveness of Dart makes it an ideal choice for learning these core concepts without sacrificing too much performance.

- Algorithms, on the other hand, are a set of operations that complete a task. This can be a sorting algorithm that moves data around to put it in order. Or it can be an algorithm that compresses an 8K picture to a manageable size. Algorithms are essential to software, and many have been created to act as building blocks for useful programs.
